About
=====

My name is Alexandre González, I am a 29 years old Spanish developer currently
working in UK, exactly in London at [GreenManGaming](http://greenmangaming.com).

I always wanted to travel, so before coming to London I was working in
Groningen, a beautiful place in Holland with my excolleagues of
[Paylogic](http://paylogic.com).

My background is mainly technical, I studied Computer Science in Spain, but at
some point during my life I was interested in business too, so I created my own
company which was a complete economic disaster, but, I learn a lot! At that time
I studied a Master in Electronic Commerce too because I thought that it could be
useful. You should know too that I am really passionate about FLOSS (Free as
Libre Open Source Software).

The main reason of writting this blog is to improve my poor English and talk
about the things that I really love, that usually are related with technology
and specially with Python. You can see in the photo that I am not lying about my
passion :D If you want to take a photo like mine, you can go to
[Efteling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efteling), I really recommend it!
